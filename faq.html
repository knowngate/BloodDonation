		<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
		<h3>Who Can Give Blood?</h3>
		<p align="justify">Most people can give blood. If you are generally in good health, age 17 to 65 (if it's your first time) and weigh at least 50kg (7st 12Ib) you can donate. However, If you are female, aged under 20 years old and weigh under 65kg (10st 3lb) and are under 168cm (5' 6") in height, we need to estimate your blood volume before donating. There is no medical reason for an upper weight limit. However, our current donation beds and chairs are designed to safely accommodate a person weighing up to 25 stone (350 lb or 158 kg). You will need to be able to get on and off the donation bed or chair unaided or, if you have mobility problems, to bring someone along to assist you.
		Male donors can give blood every 12 weeks. That's approximately every 3 months or 4 times in a 12 month period. Female donors can give every 16 weeks or approximately every 4 months

		<br/>

	You've ever injected yourself with drugs - even once.<br/>
	
	<b>You should not give blood for 12 months after sex with:</b><br/>
	A man (if you’re a male). Men who have had anal or oral sex with another man (with or without a condom) are deferred from blood donation for 12 months.<br/>
	A man who has had sex with another man (if you're a female).<br/>
	A commercial sex worker.<br/>
	Anyone who has ever injected themselves with drugs.<br/>

	<h3>Donor Health Benefits</h3><br/>
	 <p align="justify">Patients prone to iron overload, blood donation prevents the accumulation of toxic quantities.
	Donating blood may reduce the risk of heart disease for men, but the link has not been firmly established and may be from selection bias because donors are screened for health problems.
	Research published in 2012 demonstrated that repeated blood donation is effective in reducing blood pressure, blood glucose, HbA1c, low-density lipoprotein/high-density lipoprotein ratio, and heart rate.[94]
	<br/><br/></p>
	
	<h3>Recovery and time</h3><br/>
		<p align="justify">Donors are usually kept at the donation site for 10–15 minutes after donating since most adverse reactions take place during or immediately after the donation. 
		Blood centers typically provide light refreshments or a lunch allowance to help the donor recover.
		The needle site is covered with a bandage and the donor is directed to keep the bandage on for several hours.
		In hot climates, donors are advised to avoid dehydration (strenuous games, alcohol) until a few hours after donation.
		Donated plasma is replaced after 2–3 days. Red blood cells are replaced by bone marrow into the circulatory system at a slower rate, on average 36 days in healthy adult males. 
		In one study, the range was 20 to 59 days for recovery. These replacement rates are the basis of how frequently a donor can donate blood.
		Plasmapheresis and plateletpheresis donors can donate much more frequently because they do not lose significant amounts of red cells. The exact rate of how often a donor can donate differs from country to country<br/>
		<br/></p>
	<h3>Safety Precautions</h3><br/>
	<p align="justify">Donors are examined for signs and symptoms of diseases that can be transmitted in a blood transfusion, such as HIV, malaria, and viral hepatitis. Screening may include questions about risk factors for various diseases, such as travel to countries at risk for malaria or variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD). These questions vary from country to country. 
	The donor is also examined and asked specific questions about their medical history to make sure that donating blood is not hazardous to their health. The donor's hematocrit or hemoglobin level is tested to make sure that the loss of blood will not make them anemic, and this check is the most common reason that a donor is ineligible.[27] Pulse, blood pressure, and body temperature are also evaluated. Elderly donors are sometimes also deferred on age alone because of health concerns

		<h2>Blood Products</h2>
		<h3>Whole Blood</h3>
		<p align="justify">When donating whole blood, a needle will be placed in your arm to remove approximately one pint of your blood. The blood will flow through the tubing attached to the needle into a collection system. The process will take approximately 10 to 15 minutes. Your body will replace the liquid part of your blood (called plasma) in just a few hours, and the blood cells will be replaced within a few weeks. Whole blood donors can donate every 56 days.

Each donation can save up to three lives. They may not know you by name, but they will always remember your gift. With only one hour of your time, you can give a lifetime.</p>
		</p>
		<h3>Plasma</h3>
		<p align="justify">
		<b>What is Apheresis or Automated Donation?</b><br/>
		Automated donation is a type of blood donation during which blood components (platelets, plasma, or red blood cells) are donated. This is different than donating whole blood.<br/>
		
		<b>What is plasmapheresis?</b><br/>
		Plasmapheresis is the process of collecting plasma from a donor. Using a system, the plasma is collected, and the platelets and red blood cells are returned to the donor.
		Just as in whole blood donation, a needle is inserted in a donor's arm. Blood is drawn or collected through closed sterile tubing that passes through a centrifuge, which separates plasma from the whole blood. The plasma is collected in a sterile collection bag and almost all red cells and platelets are returned to the donor via the same needle.
		New sterile tubing and collection bags are used for each donor. You are never exposed to the blood of any other donor.
		<br/>
		
		<b>Who can donate plasma?</b><br/>
		Almost anyone who is a whole blood donor can donate plasma. You are eligible if you are at least 17 years old, weigh at least 110 pounds and are in generally good health. You can safely donate plasma every 28 days.<br/>
	
	<b>Why should I donate plasma?</b><br/>
	To give someone a fighting chance at life! Plasma is frequently needed by trauma patients, burn victims, and others fighting serious illness and injury. 
	There's a special need for AB Plasma. As an AB blood donor, you have a unique opportunity to enhance your generous gift of life. In addition to being the rarest blood type, AB Plasma is universal and can be used for all patients regardless of blood type.<br/>

	<h3>Platelets</h3><br/>
	<p align="justify"><b>What is Apheresis or Automated Donation?</b><br/>
		Automated donation is a type of blood donation during which blood components (platelets, plasma, or red blood cells) are donated. This is different than donating whole blood.<br/>
		
		<b>What is plateletpheresis?</b><br/>
		Plateletpheresis (pronounced Plate-let-fer-E-sis) is the process of collecting platelets from a donor. Using a system the platelets are collected, and the plasma and red blood cells are returned to the donor.
		Just as in whole blood donation, a needle is inserted in a donor's arm. Blood is drawn or collected through closed sterile tubing that passes through a centrifuge, which separates platelets from the whole blood. The platelets are collected in a sterile collection bag with almost all red cells and plasma returned to the donor via the same needle.
		New sterile tubing and collection bags are used for each donor. You are never exposed to the blood of any other donor.<br/>
		
		<b>Who can donate platelets with apheresis?</b><br/>
		Almost anyone who is a whole blood donor can donate platelets. You are eligible if you are at least 17 years old, weigh at least 110 pounds and are in generally good health. You can donate platelets every 7 days or a total of 24 times per year. Platelet donors must not take aspirin or products containing aspirin within 48 hours of their donation. Aspirin consumption takes away the "stickiness" of platelets causing the platelets to lose their ability to adhere properly when needed to stop bleeding.
		Platelet donors must not take Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDS) within 24 hours of donating. NSAIDS contain analgesic (for pain) and antipyretic (for fever) properties, which mimic the action of aspirin and interfere with platelet function for up to the first 24 hours after taking the medication.<br/>
